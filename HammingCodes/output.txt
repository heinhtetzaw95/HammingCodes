               The two SYNDROME code words are:
               -------------------------------- 
     K-bit code written into memory  ---  0 0 1 1 0
     K-bit code read from memory     ---  0 0 0 1 1

               SYNDROME word comparison is:
               ---------------------------- 
                        0 0 1 0 1

               OUTPUT MESSAGE:
               --------------- 
     The syndrome word indicates that the bit in position 5
     of the word read from memory is in error. It was read
     as a 1 and must be inverted to a 0.
